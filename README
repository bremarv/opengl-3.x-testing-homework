run make in the src folder to compile. the makefile is just so I can compile, so
everyone probably have to customize it.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:
this code makes use of opengl 3 compatible version of SDL (atm in beta). Also
uses a Vector/Matrix/Quaternion library developed by Sintef, that my class
got from our teacher. This should be released under GPL or similar sometime :)
